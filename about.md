Hi, I'm Rohit Gupta, a data geek currently pursuing a Master's in Data Science at [University of Washington, Seattle][studypg]. I graduated from [Indraprastha University][study] with a B.Tech in Electronics in 2013. I have worked on impactful problems with Fortune 100 clients at [Mu Sigma][work1], and delivered scalable solutions in a start-up environment at [Delhivery][work2].  

I love simplifying problems and solving them through analytical rigour. Primarily fascinated by the intersection of technology, business, mathematics, and pyschology. Forever struggling to remain language/tool agnostic. Fan of open-source systems. R/Python/Linux are my go-to tools. Check out some of my [projects][proj], or have a look at my [Résumé]({{ site.url }}/cv/RohitGupta_CV.pdf).

I love reading, writing and exploring stuff/places.
