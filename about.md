Hi, I'm Rohit Gupta, a data geek currently pursuing a master's in Data Science at [University of Washington, Seattle][studypg]. I graduated from [Indraprastha University][study] with a B.Tech in Electronics in 2013. I'm from New Delhi, India.  

I love simplifying problems and solving them through analytical rigour. Also fascinated by the intersection of technology, business, mathematics and pyschology. Mostly struggling to remain language/tool agnostic. Fan of open-source systems. R/Python/Linux are my Goto tools. Check out some of my [projects][proj], or have a look at my [Résumé]({{ site.url }}/cv/RohitGupta_CV.pdf).

I love reading, writing and exploring stuff/places.
